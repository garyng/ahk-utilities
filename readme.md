# AutoHotKey Scripts

Some scripts that I wrote (+ some external scripts that I collected).

# Hotkeys

- Toggle always on top and transparency (Feature stolen from `AquaSnap`)
- Decrease/Increase/Reset the transparency of the window under mouse
- Instant window switcher (Originally from [Taran VH's 2nd Keyboard repo](https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard), but refactored into classes + custom prompt before launching)
- ~~Key lister (List all hotkeys and hotstrings)~~
- Switch between virtual desktops (Adapted from [win-10-virtual-desktop-enhancer](https://github.com/sdias/win-10-virtual-desktop-enhancer), with a quite a lot of refactoring)
- Quickly minimize and maximize active window (with history)
- Show an overlay with shortcut and description
- Move mouse cursor precisely! (1px and 10px)

# Hotstrings

- Type date and time
    - > `12/11/2017 13:08:42`
- Type `git clone <url from clipboard>`
    - > `git clone git@github.com:garyng/ahk-utilities.git`
