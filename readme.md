# AutoHotKey Scripts

Some scripts that I wrote (+ some external scripts that I collected)


# Utilities

1. Type date and time, like this `12/11/2017 13:08:42`
2. Toggle always on top and transparency (Feature stolen from `AquaSnap`)
3. Decrease/Increase/Reset the transparency of the window under mouse
4. Instant window switcher (Originally from [Taran VH's 2nd Keyboard repo](https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard), but refactored into classes + custom prompt before launching)

# External Scripts
 
1. [SnapX](https://github.com/benallred/SnapX) (Removed `updater`, `run on startup` and `admin rights`)
